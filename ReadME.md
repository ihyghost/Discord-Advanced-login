**Discord Login and Copy Token Userscript**

This userscript allows a user to login to Discord using their Discord token. The userscript also adds a "Copy token" button to the login page and to the settings page.

**What is a Discord token?**

A Discord token is a secret key that gives you access to your Discord account. It is used to authenticate your requests to the Discord API. Your token should be kept secret and should not be shared with anyone.

**How does the userscript work?**

The userscript works by first adding an input field to the login page for the user to enter their Discord token. The input field will have a placeholder of "Enter your Discord token".

Next, the userscript adds a button to the login page called "Copy token". This button will, when clicked, copy the user's token to the clipboard.

Finally, the userscript adds the "Copy token" button to the settings page.

**How to use the userscript**

1. Save the userscript as a JS file.
2. Load the userscript in your browser.
3. Go to the Discord login page.
4. Enter your Discord token in the input field.
5. Click on the "Copy token" button.
6. Your token will be copied to your clipboard.

**How to keep your Discord account safe**

* **Do not share your token.** Your token is a secret key that gives you access to your Discord account. If someone else has your token, they can log in to your account and take control of it.
* **Do not paste unknown code in your console.** Code that you do not understand could contain malicious commands that could harm your computer or steal your data.
* **Do not share images of your console.** Images of your console can contain sensitive information, such as your token.
* **Use a strong password.** Your password should be at least 12 characters long and contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Enable two-factor authentication.** Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to enter a code from your phone in addition to your password when you log in.
* **Be careful about what links you click on.** If you receive a link in a message from someone you don't know, don't click on it. The link could lead to a malicious website that could steal your data.

**By following these tips, you can help keep your Discord account safe.**
